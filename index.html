<h2>Bio</h2>
<div class = "border"><p id ="two">
  I was born on june 7th 2000, for my entire life i've lived in Cornwall Ontario canada.
  I have two older brothers and two younger sisters, i'm the middle child in my
  family.since I was very young I have played video games and watched anime, both
  my brothers got me into those hobbies, they introduced me to gaming and helped
  me learn how to play games properly, even if most the time I was probably just
  playing with a controller that wasn't plugged in. In my life i have also traveled
  to different places, i've gone all around America from NY to flordia and ive been
  in the caribbeans, mexico, jamaica. I enjoy voice acting and doing youtube videos/
  streams
